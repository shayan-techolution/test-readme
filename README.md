## 📚 Algorithms Included

- 🪄 **Bubble Sort** — Simple but inefficient for large datasets.  
- ⚡ **Insertion Sort** — Efficient for small or partially sorted data.  
- 🧱 **Selection Sort** — Easy to understand, but not very fast.  
- 🪜 **Merge Sort** — Divide-and-conquer algorithm with `O(n log n)` complexity.  
- ⚙️ **Quick Sort** — One of the fastest general-purpose sorting algorithms.  
- 🧮 **Heap Sort** — Uses a heap data structure for sorting.
